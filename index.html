      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Personalized avatars play a vital role in enhancing the customer's shopping experience by allowing virtual try-on of apparel and accessories. Accurate representation of skin tone on the avatar is crucial as it provides essential cues about product interaction with different complexions. We present a comprehensive 3K-subject dataset and algorithms for accurately estimating and rendering skin tone from selfies captured in the wild. Our dataset comprises 24,000 selfie images captured in diverse environments, meticulously annotated by expert fashion specialists. The annotations include skin tone on the Fitzpatrick scale, lighting amount, and directionality. Unlike existing datasets, ours emphasizes a balanced representation of skin tones, including underrepresented darker complexions. Using a multitask CNN model trained on our dataset, we simultaneously classify illumination conditions and facial skin tones. We develop a skin tone rendering algorithm that accurately maps facial skin pixels to the target Fitzpatrick color. Additionally, we improve a state-of-art shadow removal model with better skin tone preservation, while eliminating facial shadows. Experimental results demonstrate qualitative improvements in avatar skin tone rendering, particularly under challenging lighting conditions. Our work highlights the significance of richly annotated datasets for advancing skin tone estimation. We make our dataset publicly available to facilitate further research and development in this area. Our framework contributes to creating personalized avatars that faithfully represent diverse skin tones, enhancing the shopping experience and promoting inclusivity.

        <h2>Dataset</h2>
        <p>
            Datasets used in previous related works lack diversity in
            lighting conditions and skin tones. To address this gap, we
            resorted to an unprecedented in-house data collection ef-
            fort. We employed around 3000 participants (40% males
            and 60% females) from various race and ethnicity for this
            task. Dataset link - coming soon!
